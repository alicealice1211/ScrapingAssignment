The essence of current versions of automated market makers is best expressed through the constant product equation: x * y = k

Based on it, if a swap pool owns some units of token x and some units of token y, it prices trades so that the quantities of x and y resulting after the trade, when multiplied, are equal to a fixed constant, k.

vastly more scalable architectures.
